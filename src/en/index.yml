    <li>We invest in leading companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</li>
    <li>Based on relationships of mutual trust with management teams that have the will to transform their companies, we will provide not only strategic advice but also support for the execution of strategic initiatives.</li>
    <li>We support management teams in taking risks and implementing bold strategic initiatives that fundamentally and sustainably improve their company’s growth profile and create additional value for shareholders through improved multiple valuations. We do not propose actions like share buybacks that will only improve a company’s share price in the short term.</li>
